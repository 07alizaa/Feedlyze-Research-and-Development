## Main Focus
The study investigates customer satisfaction in marts of Butwal sub-metropolitan city, Nepal, focusing on key retail attributes such as product quality, price, location, personnel services, and facilities. Its aim is to identify which factors most strongly influence customer satisfaction and provide insights for local retailers to improve competitiveness.

## Key Findings
- **Facilities** and **personnel services** have the greatest impact on customer satisfaction.  
- **Location** and **product quality** also positively influence satisfaction, whereas **price** was found to have a negative impact.  
- The study used a **descriptive and causal-comparative design**, with data collected from 289 customers via structured paper-based questionnaires.  
- **SPSS 22.0** was used for correlation and regression analysis, which explained the relationships between retail attributes and overall customer satisfaction.

## Limitations (as mentioned in the paper)
- **Sampling Limitation:** Non-probability convenience sampling was used, which may reduce the generalizability of results.  
- **Geographical Limitation:** Focused only on Butwal marts, so findings may not apply to other regions or informal market vendors in Nepal.  
- **Data Collection Method:** Reliance on structured, paper-based questionnaires could introduce response bias and is time-consuming.  
- **Analytical Scope:** Only traditional statistical methods (correlation and regression) were used; AI or NLP techniques were not employed for deeper insights.

## Relevance to Feedlyze
- Highlights the **current inefficiency of paper-based feedback collection**, which Feedlyze addresses with **digital mobile- and web-based forms**.  
- Shows that traditional surveys **cannot scale well** for small vendors or provide real-time insights. Feedlyze solves this with **automated data collection and AI/NLP analysis**.  
- Confirms that **small vendors in Nepal lack tools for actionable insights**; Feedlyze provides dashboards that summarize trends, sentiments, and preferences for informed decision-making.  
- Validates the need for **privacy-preserving and multilingual feedback systems**, as the study did not explore these aspects.
