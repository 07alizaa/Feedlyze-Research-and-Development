# Aim and Application to be Developed

## Aim
To design and develop an AI-powered, privacy-focused feedback management platform that enables businesses in Nepal to collect, analyze, and act on customer feedback effectively through smart analytics, QR-enabled forms, and role-based dashboards.

## Application to be Developed
The application **Feedlyze** will be a full-stack web platform enabling businesses to design custom feedback forms through a drag-and-drop builder. Each form will generate a QR code for customer access. Customers can submit feedback anonymously or with optional details, and the platform will apply AI models to analyze sentiment and authenticity. Vendors will access a dashboard to view analytics, while admins will oversee vendor verification, form approvals, and overall system governance.  

The system will be developed using:
- **Frontend:** React  
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
