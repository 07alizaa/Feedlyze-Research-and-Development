# Problem Statement

Businesses in Nepal, especially small and medium enterprises, face difficulties in collecting authentic and actionable customer feedback. Traditional feedback methods such as paper-based surveys, Google Forms, or social media reviews often lack privacy, authenticity, and data-driven insights. Fake or biased reviews further reduce reliability, while customers hesitate to provide honest feedback due to privacy concerns. This creates a gap between businesses and customers, limiting service improvements and innovation.
